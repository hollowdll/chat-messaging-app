# Tech and tools

- Developed with Spring Boot framework.
- Java as main language.
- Client code uses JavaScript.
- HTML views created with Thymeleaf template engine.
- MVC controllers contain endpoint-specific code and return views to users depending on requests.
- Application secured with Spring security. All users have USER role. Admin role is not needed.
- Spring JDBC for database operations. Data Access Objects with custom SQL queries that use Spring JdbcTemplate. No Spring Data JPA repositories.
- WebSocket server and WebSocket client. In this project, WebSocket is used to send user messages in realtime to all subscribed clients, so users don't have to refresh page every time a new message is sent.
- Server-side validation for user inputs.
- Database connection with JDBC to PostgreSQL database.
- Database schema is generated on application startup and it is defined in schema.sql file.
- Application properties use environment variables to load database configurations (url, password, etc.)

- Custom error page. Default whitelabel error page is disabled for users.
